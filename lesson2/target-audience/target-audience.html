    Most weather forecasts are targeted to one of four areas. These include the private sector, agriculture, the general public and other meteorologists. The private sector includes clients such as oil refineries, fruit and vegetable growers, cattle ranchers, casinos, airlines, ski resorts, electric companies, entertainment, railroads, newspapers and so forth. Much of the forecasting for the private sector is done through large specialized forecast businesses such as AccuWeather, The Weather Channel and WeatherData. The aim is to save businesses money by preparing them for upcoming weather situations (especially severe weather and winter storms) and through accurate temperature forecasts. The forecasts are often specialized to the clients needs. The amount of forecast specialization determines the cost of the services rendered.Sometimes,  the audience need the accurate weather for growing their corns, or they need to make sure the weather so they can do some activity outdoor.
